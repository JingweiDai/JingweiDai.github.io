I am currently an MPhil student in marketing at [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/). I am interested in economics of information systems, quantitative marketing, and applied economics. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2ohtDo4jH8DBWChhW9Xys2WQNjoBYWR/view?usp=sharing).

The topics that I am interested in include Economics of Information Systems, Sharing Economy, Innovation, and Digital Marketing. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, empirical IO, and applied machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.
