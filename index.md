Hi! I am a PhD student in information systems management at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).  My research interests include Economics of Information Systems, Digital Marketing, and Platform Economy. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, empirical IO, and machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.

Working Paper:

Online-Offline Price Difference and Consumer Fairness Concerns: A Natural Experiment on the Food Delivery Platform, with Hui Li

    <p><small>This paper discusses how online-offline menu price difference affects consumer purchase, restaurant revenue, and platform traffic. It leverages a natural experiment in the Taiwan food delivery platform, and explores the mechanism of consumer fairness concerns. We find that having online mark-up will negatively affect restaurant order volume and number of dishes purchased per order. We also find that factors related to consumersâ€™ fairness concerns moderate the effect: expensive restaurants, restaurants with fewer nearby marked-up restaurants, and experienced consumers were more affected, as consumers take restaurant costs, other restaurants, and past pricing rules as reference points. </small></p>
