I am currently a graduate student in marketing at [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/). I am interested in information systems, quantitative marketing, and applied economics. 

The topics that I am interested in include digital marketing, economics of digitization, word of mouth, and social network. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, and applied machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and accompanying my family members.
