  My research interests include Economics of Information Systems, Digital Marketing, Platform Economy, and Innovation. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, empirical IO, and machine learning to do research.

  When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.
