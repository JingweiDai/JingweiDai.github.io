I am currently an MPhil student in marketing at [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/). I am interested in economics of information systems, quantitative marketing, and applied economics. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2ohtDo4jH8DBWChhW9Xys2WQNjoBYWR/view?usp=sharing).

The topics that I am interested in include digital marketing, economics of information systems, sharing economy, and word of mouth. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, and applied machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and accompanying my family members.
