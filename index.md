I am currently an MPhil student in marketing at [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/). I am interested in economics of information systems, digital marketing, and applied economics.

The topics that I am interested in include Economics of Information Systems, Digital Marketing, Sharing Economy, and Innovation. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference and econometric methods to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.
