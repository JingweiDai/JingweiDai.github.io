I am a PhD student in information systems management at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Previously, I was an MPhil student in marketing at [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/).

The topics that I am interested in include Economics of Information Systems, Digital Marketing, Sharing Economy, and Innovation. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, empirical IO, and machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.
