Hi! I am a PhD student in information systems management at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).  My research interests include Economics of Information Systems, Digital Marketing, and Platform Economy. Methodologically, I am interested in employing causal inference, econometric methods, and machine learning to do research.

When I am not working, I enjoy cycling, hiking with friends, reading, volunteering, and doing pull-ups.
