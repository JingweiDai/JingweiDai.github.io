**Working Paper**:

Online-Offline Price Difference and Consumer Fairness Concerns: A Natural Experiment on the Food Delivery Platform, with Hui Li

<div style="display:none">
This paper discusses how online-offline menu price difference affects consumer purchase, restaurant revenue, and platform traffic. It leverages a natural experiment in the Taiwan food delivery platform, and explores the mechanism of consumer fairness concerns. We find that having online mark-up will negatively affect restaurant order volume and the number of dishes purchased per order. We also find that factors related to consumersâ€™ fairness concerns moderate the effect: expensive restaurants, restaurants with fewer nearby marked-up restaurants, and experienced consumers were more affected, as consumers take restaurant costs, other restaurants, and past pricing rules as reference points.
